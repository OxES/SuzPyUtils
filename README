SuzUtils - Suzanne Aigrain

This repository contains miscellaneous bits of code I have written or
pilfered, which I use often, and which I thought might be usefuly to
others, but weren't substantial enough to warrant their own
repository. I have tried to document each routine / module reasonably
well. Comments / feedback welcome! Also please let me know if you make
significant improvements to any of these that you think I should
incorporate.

Currently included

- periodograms: Various tools for time-series analysis in the Fourier domain.
  - sinefit: least squares fitting of sine curves to a time-series
    with arbitrary time-sampling (this is a generalisation of the
    Lomb-Scargle periodogram, but it doesn't include the false alarm
    probability and significance measures, which are almost always
    misleading anyway)
  - DftPowerspectrum: compute and plot the power spectrum of a regularly
    sampled time-series using the discr ete FFT (shows how to get the
    normalisation right, and which frequencies correspond to which
    element in the array)
  - AcfPeriodogram: compute and plot the ACF of a regularly sampled
    time-series and its amplitude spectrum (also known as the
    periodogram of the time-series), after optional smoothing.

- filter: routines to filter time-series (or any 1-D dataset)
  - filt1d: combination of linear (boxcar or gauss) and median filter,
    with edge reflection or circular edge criterion
  - boxcare: boxcar (moving average) filter with edge reflection or
    circular edge criterion
  - gausse: Gaussian (tapered window) filter with edge reflection or
    circular edge criterion
  - NIF: iterative version of filt1d with k-sigma clipping (Aigrain &
    Irwin 2004)

- norm: NaN-robust wrappers for min, max, mean, median, sum, plus
  routines to compute median and MAD-estimated scatter, to normalise
  to zero mean and unit variance, and to scale to range from 0 to 1.

- multiplot: routines to make plots with shared axes

- mpfit: non-linear least squares optimization using
  Levenberg-Marquart algorithm, with option to fix or bound some
  parameters. Adapted by me from a really old version that was itself
  adapted from the IDL routine of the same name. Horribly cumbersome
  and rather unstable but quite useful because very generic.
